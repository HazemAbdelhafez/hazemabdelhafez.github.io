abstract="This study characterizes the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 and TX1 Platforms, both built on a NVIDIA Tegra System on Chip and combining a quad-core ARM CPU and an NVIDIA GPU. Their heterogeneous nature, as well as their wide operating frequency range, make it hard for application developers to reason about performance and determine which optimizations are worth pursuing. This paper attempts to inform developers' choices by characterizing the platforms' performance using Roofline models obtained through an empirical measurement-based approach as well as through a case study of a heterogeneous application (matrix multiplication). Our results highlight a difference of more than an order of magnitude in compute performance between the CPU and GPU on both platforms. Given that the CPU and GPU share the same memory bus, their Roofline models' balance points are also more than an order of magnitude apart. We also explore the impact of frequency scaling: build CPU and GPU Roofline profiles and characterize both platforms' balance point variation, power consumption, and performance per watt as frequency is scaled.",
