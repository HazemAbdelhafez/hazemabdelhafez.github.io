The NVIDIA Jetson AGX, for example, has a user-configurable frequency range larger than one order of magnitude for the CPU, the GPU, and the memory controller. Key to make effective use of this configurability is the ability to anticipate the application-level impact of a frequency configuration choice. To this end, this paper presents a novel modeling approach for predicting the runtime and power consumption for convolutional neural net-works (CNNs). This modeling approach is: (i) effective - i.e., makes predictions with low error (models achieve an average relative error of 15.4% for runtime and 14.9% for energy); (ii) efficient - i.e., has a low cost to make predictions; (iii) generic - i.e., supports deploying updated and possibly different deep learning inference models without the need for retraining, and (iv) practical - i.e., requires a low training cost. Three features, all geared towards meeting the challenges of deploying in a real-world environment, set this work apart: (i) the focus on predicting the impact of the frequency configuration choice, (ii) the methodological choice to aggregate predictions at fine (i.e., kernel level) granularity which provides generality; and (iii) taking into account the inter-node variability among nominally identical devices.","tags":[],"title":"MIRAGE: Machine Learning-based Modeling of Identical Replicas of the Jetson AGX Embedded Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hazem A.

We focus on a popular platform designed for edge applications, the NVIDIA Jetson AGX, and aim to answer the following high-level questions through rigorous statistical analysis: (i) are the edge devices in our study statistically different from each other in terms of applications' runtime performance and power draw (although they are sold under the same product model and family)?, (ii) if the differences between these edge devices are statistically significant, what is the magnitude of these differences?, and (iii) do these differences matter from the application's perspective?.","tags":[],"title":"Snowflakes at the Edge: A Study of Variability among NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Boards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hazem A.

These platforms incorporate several co-processors on a single chip with a shared physical memory. The use cases for such platforms can vary dramatically. On the one hand, they can be used in the context of Edge computing, which cannot tolerate high latency and has strict energy/power constraints. On the other hand, motivated by their growing computing capabilities, and their energy-efficiency, many have considered replacing traditional bulky servers with these platforms to deliver the same computing power but with lower energy budget. This study is an exploratory step to understand the trade-off between power consumption, processing time, and throughput on a low-power heterogeneous platform. We focus on data stream processing workloads by characterizing several common computing kernels found in computer vision algorithms.

Their heterogeneous nature, as well as their wide operating frequency range, make it hard for application developers to reason about performance and determine which optimizations are worth pursuing. This paper attempts to inform developers‚Äô choices by characterizing the platforms‚Äô performance using Roofline models obtained through an empirical measurement-based approach as well as through a case study of a heterogeneous application (matrix multiplication). Our results highlight a difference of more than an order of magnitude in compute performance between the CPU and GPU on both platforms. Given that the CPU and GPU share the same memory bus, their Roofline models‚Äô balance points are also more than an order of magnitude apart. We also explore the impact of frequency scaling build CPU and GPU Roofline profiles and characterize both platforms‚Äô balance point variation, power consumption, and performance per watt as frequency is scaled. The characterization we provide can be used in two main ways. First, given an application, it can inform the choice and number of processing elements to use (i.e., CPU/GPU and number of cores) as well as the optimizations likely to lead to high performance gains. Secondly, this characterization indicates that developers can use frequency scaling to tune the Jetson Platform to suit the requirements of their applications. Third, given a required power/performance budget, application developers can identify the appropriate parameters to use to tune the Jetson platforms to their specific workload requirements. We expect that this optimization approach can lead to overall gains in performance and/or power efficiency without requiring application changes.","tags":[],"title":"NVIDIA Jetson Platform Characterization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Many studies stated that most of the assigned radio spectrum is underutilized. This tight situation was a motive to turn into Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) and design systems that could handle DSA efficiently. We designed an integrated Cloud Spectrum Management System (CSMS). In this system we introduce a Cloud Spectrum Broker (CSB) that uses geo-location cloud-based database to monitor and share radio spectrum between Primary Users (PUs) and Secondary Users (SUs). The core of CSMS is the trading engine, which is designed to handle requests from competing SUs in an auction-based algorithm. The architecture and vital building blocks of the Cloud Spectrum Management System (CSMS) are discussed in details in this paper.","tags":[],"title":"Cloud-Assisted Spectrum Management System with Trading Engine","type":"publication"}]
